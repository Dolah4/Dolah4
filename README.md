ABDULLAH BIN HASSAN - Data Analyst Portfolio

About
I am a motivated individual with a background in education, retail management, and a growing passion for data analysis. My career began in counseling and electronic engineering, where I developed skills that I’ve applied in various roles. As an Academic Tutor, I had the privilege of helping students improve in Physics, Science, and Computer subjects. My time as an Assistant Supervisor at Mr.DIY allowed me to support my team in optimizing operations and enhancing customer experiences.

Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in data analysis through the K-Youth Development Program, where I’m learning the ropes of Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I’m eager to apply these skills in real-world scenarios, contributing to meaningful outcomes in an organization that values data-driven insights.

I believe in continuous learning and am excited about the opportunity to grow and contribute in a data analysis role, bringing a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a genuine desire to make a positive impact
